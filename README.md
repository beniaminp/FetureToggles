Hello!
In order to run this project, you need to have Java 11, node and angular cli.

First, on the project root folder, run mvn clean install.

After that, cd to front-end/feature-toggle and run npm install.

Start the server as you wish (from IDE, build-it) and then cd again to front-end/feature-toggle and run ng serve.

The server will start on port 8082 and the Angular application on 4200.

Enjoy!
